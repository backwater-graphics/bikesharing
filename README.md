## Overview 

Citi Bike company is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system that services New York City and was designed to give residents and visitors a fun, affordable and convenient alternative to walking, taxis, buses and or using the subways. 
The purpose of this project was to review Citi Bikes data from their New York City official bike share business to determine the viability of setting up a Citi bike-sharing business in the city of Des Moines, Iowa.
By using Tableau as data visualization tool we can show the investors that Des Moines Iowa will be a solid investment based on the key factors listed below:
-	Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
-	Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
-	Number of bike trips for each user type and gender for each day of the week.
-	Start and stop locations for all riders and genders.

## Results

### Checkout times for users and by Gender

![Check out Times]( https://github.com/backwater-graphics/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/Checkout%20Times.png )

<b>Visualization #1</b>: Looking at visualizations above for 'Checkout Times for Users' and 'Checkout Times by Gender', we see that most rides are for 20 minutes or less, and that most rides are less than one hour. We also see that this pattern is the same regardless of gender.


### Starting and Ending Locations

<b>Visualization #2</b>: Comparing visualizations for the 'Top Starting Locations' and 'Top Ending Locations', we can see that the most active starting locations are also among the most active ending locations. This is important, because we need to know whether there might be an excess or shortage of bikes at particularly stations over time.


### Gender Breakdown

![Gender breakdown]( https://github.com/backwater-graphics/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/gender.png)

<b>Visualization #3</b>: The 'Gender Breakdown' pie chart shows that males in NYC utilize the bike sharing program almost 3 times as often as females. Further analysis is needed to understand why this is the case.


### Trips by Weekday per Hour

![Trips by Weekday per hour]( https://github.com/backwater-graphics/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/UserType.png)

<b>Visualization #4</b>: The heatmap of 'Trips by Weekday per Hour' shows a clear pattern of bicycle usage 1) during the morning weekday commute (7-9 a.m.), 2) during the evening weekday commute (4-7 p.m.) except on Wednesday evenings, and 3) all day long on weekends.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

![Trips by gender](https://github.com/backwater-graphics/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/Trips%20by%20Gender(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)

<b>Visualization #5</b>: The 'Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)' heatmap shows that the usage pattern is true regardless of gender, although the total number for males is considerably higher.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

<b>Visualization #6</b>: The 'User Trips by Gender by Weekday' heatmap demonstrates the following points: subscribers are mostly male and account for most of the weekday activity, customers' gender are often unknown, and useage on the weekend is more evenly split between subscribers and customers.

### Bike Utilization and Bike Repairs

![Bike repair](https://github.com/backwater-graphics/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/Bike%20Repair.png)

<b>Visualization #7</b>: Our 'Bike Utilization' and 'Bike Repairs' charts show that some bikes are used for many trips and many total hours, while other bikes are hardly used at all. More analysis is called for to assess whether there are predictable patterns of use for high- or low-use bikes.

## Summary

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem to be a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.
If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization, given the data provided, I would explore:

- Comparing data for different months to determine trends across the year.
- Including weather data to find the correlation between the weather and the rides.
